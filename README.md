# powercord-no-swearing
it's simple, no swearing in powercord!

i made this at 11 pm while watching a twitch stream and not being able to think too clearly, same with when i uploaded this to github

if something doesn't work or if you make a PR, ping me (`<@881310086411190293>`) in #plugin-dev on 
powercord's discord

ok hi! it's skye here! i have just updated this plugin so that you can whitelist specific channels, based on their ID

to do this, just go to settings -> No Swearing and add the channel IDs to the text box there, seperated by `,`

for example, it would look something like `firstchannelid,secondchannelid` but with actual IDs instead of just strings

if you want to whitelist DMs, you can run a new command I've added, to get the ID of a DM channel, or any channel if you want: `{prefix}currentChannelId`

adding DMs works exactly the same as adding normal text channels
